The synthRFH_findLoops and synthRFH_addLoopGainInfo functions return loop
information structure arrays (with one entry per loop found). These arrays
have the following fields:


From synthRFH_findLoops:

"label" is a unique identifier for the loop (the concatenation of the
  letters associated with each region in the loop's path).

"regionsvisited" is a vector containing the indices of each region in the
  loop's path. The first index is repeated as the last index.

"delay" is the propagation time for one cycle around the loop, in seconds.

"isinverting" is true if the product of the loop's edge couplings is
  negative, and false if the product is positive.

"frequency" is the loop's fundamental mode frequency in Hz (1/delay if
  non-inverting, half that if inverting).

"attenuation" is the loop's attenuation at its fundamental mode frequency
  due to low-pass effects from the alpha, beta, and gamma model parameters.
  This will be 1 if the signal is passed perfectly and less than 1 if not.



From synthRFH_addLoopGainInfo:

"cyclegainraw" is the small-signal gain from traversing once around the
  loop, without taking into account filter attenuation.

"cyclegain" is the small-signal gain from traversing once around the
  loop with filter attenuation taken into account.

"envelopetau" is the time constant for the growth (positive) or decay
  (negative) of the oscillation envelope. The envelope is exp(t/tau).

Optional:

"cyclegaingradient" is the gradient with respect to "intcouplings" of
  "cyclegain". This is a 4x4 matrix indexed by (destination, source)
  specifying the partial derivatives of "cyclegain" with respect to the
  coupling weights between excitatory, inhibitory, specific nucleus, and
  reticular nucleus neural populations.
