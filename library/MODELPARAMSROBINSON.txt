Sigmoid parameters (common to all):

"qmax" is the maximum firing rate (1/sec); typically 250.
"threshlevel" is the average neuronal threshold (mV); typically 15.
"threshsigma" is the standard deviation of the neuronal threshold (mV);
  typically 6.0.


Neural dynamics parameters (common to all):

"alpha" is the inverse decay time (1/sec); typically 50.
"beta" is the inverse rise time (1/sec); typically 200.
"gamma" is the inverse within-cortex propagation time (1/sec); typically 100.


Cortico-thalamic circuit parameters (for simulateNetwork):

"halfdelay_ms" is half of the round-trip cortex/thalamus loop time (ms);
  typically 40.


Additional coupling parameters (for simulateNetwork):

"noisecoupling" is the coupling weight of noise into the specific nucleus.
  Typically 0.5.
"mixturecoupling" is the coupling weight of mixed-population cortex
  excitatory signals into the cortex. Typically 0.07.


Noise generation parameters (for simulateNetwork):

"noisemean" is the mean noise signal value; typically 0.
"noisesigma" is the standard deviation of additive noise; typically 0.1.
"noisemultfactor" is "chi" in Freyer 2011/Hindriks 2023; the standard
  deviation of multiplicative noise is chi * noisesigma. Typically 0.3.
