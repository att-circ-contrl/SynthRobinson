\chapter{Overview}
\label{sect-over}

This document describes the models used for synthesizing proxy neural
activity using the ``\texttt{nlSynth\_}'' family of library functions.

These functions are primarily intended to produce realistic-looking signals
with known qualities to test analysis scripts with. That said, these models
are drawn from publications where they were used to provide insight into
the functioning of brain networks, so using these functions for such
research is an additional use-case.

Chapter \ref{sect-robinson} describes the neural model presented in
Robinson 2002 (and elaborated on in Freyer 2011 and Hindriks 2023). This
is a model of average firing rates of multiple neural populations in the
cortex and thalamus, with feedback connections that drive noise-excited
oscillations.
